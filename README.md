# Splashr-X - High Quality Unsplash Viewer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/buenaflor/Splashr-X.svg?branch=develop](https://travis-ci.org/buenaflor/Splashr-X)

Splashr-X is a hobby project that is being programmed out of fun and for learning purposes. I try to use as little third-party libraries as possible to keep the code nice and clean.

You can read our [documentation](https://buenaflor.github.io/Splashr-X/) for detailed information about the code.
